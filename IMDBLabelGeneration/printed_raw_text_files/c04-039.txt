VERDICT: The "bunk" needed doubling. DONALD HOUSTON had a big success
on A T V's "Drama '61" last night as a smooth, scheming jewel thief in a play by
Jacques Gillies, "The Takers." A polished production by Quentin Lawrence, here, held
together by Mr. Houston's accomplished performance as the master mind behind a
gang of crooks.
