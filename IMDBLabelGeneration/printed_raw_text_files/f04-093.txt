At Clapham Junction a ticket-collector was able to identify a photograph of the girl,
and he said he had last seen her on platform six waiting to board a train for the short
run to Victoria. A passenger at Victoria said he had seen a young lady "as near as
possible" like the photograph shown him, with a man "very close in conversation and
walking arm in arm."
