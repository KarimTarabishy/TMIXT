Senator Allen Ellender, of Louisiana, sparked off the opposition by telling a television
audience it was "current Washington gossip" that Weaver once had Communist affilia-
tions. The Senate Banking Committee, which is headed by another Southern Senator
- Willis Robertson, of Virginia - met today in closed session to discuss Weaver's ap-
pointment. Senator Robertson later disclosed he had sent a letter to Mr. Kennedy
saying he had received several complaints about Weaver's loyalty.
