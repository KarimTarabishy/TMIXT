Strangely enough, the Berlin audience received the film with extreme coolness, much
preferring Jean-Luc Godard's disappointing "Une Femme est une Femme," a ninety-
one minute hymn to "Vogue," "Cahiers du Cinema," and the worst aspects of the
American cinema. From a brilliantly funny start, the work fizzles out into a series of
repetitious sight-gags and personal jokes incomprehensible to the uninitiated (includ-
ing four plugs for Charles Aznavour).
