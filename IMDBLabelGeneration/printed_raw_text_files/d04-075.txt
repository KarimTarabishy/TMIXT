The Messusah, which is nailed on the doorposts contains those two lessons. The
third lesson of the Shmah (Numbers 15, 37-41) is called "the going-out of the land of
Egypt". It starts with the story of the fringes the "tsitsits". This lesson used to be
read only in the morning. And the Talmud tells a story, which is also in the Hagadah
that Rabbi Eleasar ben Assarja said, "I am nearly seventy and I had not succeeded that people should read 'the going out of Egypt' the passage Numbers 15, 37-41, by
night", because the fringes (tsitsits) are only used in the day; till Ben Zoma came
and explained the verse (Deut. 16, 3) "that 1thou 1mayest remember the day when
1thou 1camest forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of 1thy life."
